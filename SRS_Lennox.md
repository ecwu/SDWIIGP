## Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to show the detail description of the Gym management System.  It will talk about the feature of the system(what the system can do for customers), the interface of the system,  the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system and will be proposed to the Gigi Ji for her approval.

## Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions(TBD)



## project Scope (not finish)

The targeted user groups are those who set up accounts in this system and staffs of the gymnasium. The aim of the system is to give another way for customers to visit the gymnasium and help in reducing customers' time waste.

## Product Feature

It will provide a platform for customers to make operations, such as recharging, viewing information of the gymnasium,  inquiring their personal account and making appointment with the coach they want. It's just like things they can do at the counter. Since they can make operations on the Internet, there is no doubt that it can help in reducing customers' time waste.
